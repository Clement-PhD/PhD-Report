## day

### Wen 06

continuing search about the subject
- [X] install i3 without nixos, or use nixos with crypt of disk, and lina derivated -> No need for Lina now, all backup are on github
- [X] See alternative to hyperAst -> Not really, their are snapshot AST (tree-sitter, asteria...) but not for an integral repo
- [X] Access to software heritage and exploration -> add [repo](https://github.com/Clement-PhD/Software-heritage-playground)
- [X] See the differents vulnerabilities catalog -> only mitre, but need cleaning
