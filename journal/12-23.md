## day

### Wed 13
Fix experiments, beginning to work on it.

- [X] explore rq : attack on supply chain : analyse of the dependance of open source project > Idea of experiments : extract package name + version from mitre, store this in a structure optimized for search (hashmap + memory ?), use the tool from romain to extract the file related to the packet manager, compare all the dependencies with the list. Challenge : extraction of CVE can be tricky, analyse of first dependencies are easy, but the link with the dependencie of the dependencie no. -> focus on the other

- [X] explore research question (rq): Joern/tree-sitter > compare perf/time limit with hyperAst, Maybe make small experiment with one known CVE -> try to detect it inside the repo > creating the [experiment](/experiments/first_experiment/first_experiment.md)

### Mon 11
Make slide for fall seminar
Make an environnement to run tool of romain
trying to run gemoc
- [X] make work the [tool](https://github.com/RomainLefeuvre/DatasetBuilder/tree/master) of romain -> pull request

### Fri 08
Make a working java environnement, load the graph in memory and do some manipulation on it.
- [X] understand the [graph api](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-graph/index.html)

### Thu 07
Found [this](https://dasfreak.github.io/Backstabbers-Knife-Collection/) => backstabber's knife collection (CVE dataset), but need mail to have accesss

read paper on supply chain > not interested a lot

- [X] Read, undersand and explore paper of lefeuvre (Romain Lefeuvre et al., “Fingerprinting and Building Large Reproducible Datasets,” in Proceedings of the 2023 ACM Conference on Reproducibility and Replicability (ACM REP ’23: 2023 ACM Conference on Reproducibility and Replicability, Santa Cruz CA USA: ACM, 2023), 27–36, https://doi.org/10.1145/3589806.3600043.)

- [X] Ask Romain for the SWH local instance and question
meeting with romain :
swh : focus on his papaer, his repo and the graph, try to understand the graph api, make the nix env for the repo and java

play with aws, make some boto3 script helper, retrieve graph from swh repo

### Wen 06

continuing search about the subject
- [X] install i3 without nixos, or use nixos with crypt of disk, and lina derivated -> No need for Lina now, all backup are on github
- [X] See alternative to hyperAst -> Not really, their are snapshot AST (tree-sitter, asteria...) but not for an integral repo
- [X] Access to software heritage and exploration -> add [repo](https://github.com/Clement-PhD/Software-heritage-playground)
- [X] See the differents vulnerabilities catalog -> only mitre, but need cleaning

### Tue 05
Install nixos and i3.
state of the art on the detection of the 0-day vulnerability

### Mon 04
Trying to make work i3 (failed -> work home), installing [mandatory](https://gitlab.inria.fr/i4s-works/welcome-package/-/blob/main/Day1.md?ref_type=heads) software

- [x] installing Deja Dup and configuring
- [x] installing [Atempo Lina](https://doc-si.inria.fr/display/SU/Doc+Sauvegarde+Atempo#tab-Linux) and configuring

Install zotero and link it

Beginning the lecture and the notes on hyperAst

### fri 01
Arrival to inria, setup of the first laptop given (Dell precision 7560) :
- 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11850H @ 2.50GHz
- RTX A3000 Mobile

Add Ubuntu and crypt the disk
